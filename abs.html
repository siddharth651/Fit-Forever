              1.Sit on the seat of an abdominal crunch machine and grab two top handles behind your head. Your arms
              should be bent at a 90 degree angle as you rest the triceps on the pads provided. Place your feet behind
              the lower roller pads.<br>
              2.Depending on the machine’s design, your hands grasp handles alongside your head or simply rest on the
              chest pad.<br>

            <h3 class="prem">BENEFITS</h3>

            <p>

              The user is provided with a full range of motion that otherwise might not have been possible. This is
              essential for those who want to see quality results that will last for a long time.

              Getting a full range of motion makes sure each crunch that is being done is maximized for its true
              potential. Most individuals without the machine will not be able to achieve those desired results because
              their form is bad.

              This machine helps streamline the movement to ensure the ab crunch is being done properly every single
              time. For those who want to see results, this is essential.

            <p>
              1.The proper way to do the cable crunch is to keep the butt high while leaning forward at the torso, then
              you’ll crunch down by contracting your abdominals. <br>
              2.Your abs should be fully engaged during each repetition as this is the muscle you’re trying to work
              rather than your hip flexors.<br>
              3.Also, you can do the cable crunch facing the machine or the other way which is totally up to the
              individual.<br>

              1.Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and lie down.<br>
              2.Now place your hands lightly on either side of your head keeping your elbows in. Tip: Don't lock your
              fingers behind your head.<br>
              3.While pushing the small of your back down in the bench to better isolate your abdominal muscles, begin
              to roll your shoulders off it.<br>

              It works your core muscles, squeezing them in a more intense way than other abdominal exercises.
              The decline crunch relies on the abs to push the body off the bench and so results in maximum contraction.
              For those who have become proficient in decline sit ups, adding some extra weights will help in
              maintaining the difficulty level.

              3.Reach your arms straight out in front, interlacing your fingers or clasping your hands together.<br>
              4.Use your abdominals to twist to the right, then back to center, and then to the left.<rr>
                5.This is 1 repetition. Do 2 to 3 sets of 8 to 16 repetitions.<br>

            <p>
              1.You can do the roll-out with a variety of equipment – a dedicated abs roller (if your gym has one),
              dumbbells (opt for round dumbbells, rather than hexagonal, for obvious reasons), a barbell or a gym ball.
              The movement and benefits are similar with a roller, barbell or dumbbells, but there’s an extra challenge
              to using a gym ball<br>
              2. Kneel on the ground with the roller in front of you. Lean forwards slightly so the roller is directly
              underneath your shoulders, then grab the handles. Engage your core, then push the roller forwards as far
              as you can without breaking form – you don’t want your upper body to buckle and sag. Then roll back to the
              starting position.
            <h3 class="prem">BENEFITS</h3>

            <p>
              1.Full Engagement: Rollouts challenge and engage the full core (rectus abdominis, external, and internal
              obliques), as opposed to focusing on something like the upper and lower abs alone.<br>
              2.Easy Periodization: You can periodize them linearly pretty easily, so you can accurately track your
              progress with them. No guess work on strength gains.
