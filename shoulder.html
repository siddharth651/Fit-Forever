              1.Build Big Delts. This exercise allows you to really emphasize the deltoids with moderate to heavy loads.
              While you may not be able to lift as much total weight as with the barbell overhead press, you can still
              move some pretty heavy-ass iron. <br>
              2.Get Wider Shoulders. Since this exercise uses dumbbells, you can hold and maneuver the weights more
              freely than with a barbell. And so, the dumbbell press hits the lateral deltoids more intensely than
              barbell shoulder press movements.<br>
              3.Work the Stabilizer Muscles. Since dumbbells force you to move the weights individually with each hand,
              you must utilize stabilizer muscles. This provides the benefit of improved control and balance of the
              shoulders and upper arms.

              1.Pick a couple of dumbbells and stand with a straight torso and the dumbbells by your side at arms length
              with the palms of the hand facing you. This will be your starting position.<br>
              2.While maintaining the torso in a stationary position (no swinging), lift the dumbbells to your side with
              a slight bend on the elbow and the hands slightly tilted forward as if pouring water in a glass. <br>
              3.Lower the dumbbells back down slowly to the starting position as you inhale.

              2.With your arms straight, bring your shoulders back, engage your abs, and take a breath.<br>
              3.Shrug both dumbbells up as you keep your arms straight. Go up as much as you can. You can use the cue of
              ‘touching your ears with the top of your shoulders. It’s impossible, but it’s helpful.<br>
              4.Hold the top position for a moment and release both dumbbells as you exhale.

              1.Injury Prevention Benefits:Among one of the most common serious injuries are those of the neck and back,
              of which may be caused by whiplash injuries, improper weight distribution loading or even simple
              overextension resulting in strain and tearing.<br>
              2.Posture Benefits:The trapezius muscles are primarily responsible for the movement of the cervical
              portion of the spinal cord as well as the retraction of the scapula or shoulder blades, both of which are
              paramount areas in the observance of proper upper body posture.

              1.Holding a dumbbell in each hand, bend at the hips and knees until your torso is parallel to the
              floor.<br>
              2.The back should be straight and your arms should be hanging in front of you, with your palms facing
              inwards (neutral grip).<br>
              3.Keeping your elbows slightly bent, raise both arms out to the sides until the dumbbells are level with
              the height of your shoulders<br>
              4.Hold for a count of two and then slowly lower the dumbbells to the starting position in a controlled
              manner. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

            <p>
              1.More Defined Shoulders
              Isolated movements are designed to target and activate specific muscle groups. Bent over reverse dumbbell
              fly is an extremely effective exercise, that can add more muscle size and strength to your posterior or
              rear delts, when performed at a prescribed number of sets and reps within a strength training program.<br>

              2.More Strength:
              Strength and muscle mass are positively correlated, therefore the more muscle you build, theoretically the
              more strength you will gain. By incorporating the bent over reverse dumbbell fly into your upper body
              training routine you will build more muscle mass and strength.

              1.Sit down on the reverse fly machine facing the weight stack and get the seat in the position that allows
              you to grab the handles so your hands are in line with your elbows and shoulders.<br>
              2.Position the handles so they are as far back towards the weight stack as possible. They should be
              together on the last setting.<br>
              3.Keep your shoulders down, chest up, and torso upright with your chest glued to the pad.<br>
              4.Push with the side of your hands and pull your arms back until you feel a contraction in your upper back
              and rear delt.

              1.By training your posterior deltoids, the reverse pec deck machine develops your shoulder muscles.Strong
              shoulders play an important role in a range of workouts.<br>
              Simultaneous benefits of stronger shoulder muscles include improved effectiveness in complex exercises
              like the barbell bench press, deadlift, and overhead press.
