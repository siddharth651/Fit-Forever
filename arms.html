          <h3 class="prem">HOW TO DO IT?</h3>

   
  <p>

  </P>
  <h3 class="prem">BENEFITS</h3>

 <p>
    1.A barbell curl exercise works on your bicep muscles- brachialis and brachioradialis. These are the muscles that you use not just during workouts but also for doing the smallest everyday movements such as picking up things, driving, etc. By activating and challenging these muscles, you get better upper body strength. <br>
    2.This is an excellent exercise to improve your grip strength. This helps in making your daily tasks easier. It also lets you perform exercises such as bench presses and deadlifts easily.<br>
    3.Barbell curl is a great weight loss exercise. It helps crank up calories and helps you achieve your optimum weight level. This gives you a toned appearance and also prevents obesity-related health problems such as kidney diseases, heart problems, and diabetes, etc.

    <div class="col-md-6 content">

    <h3 class="prem">HOW TO DO IT?</h3>
      <div class="exePara">
      <p>
        1.Start by bracing your abdominals.<br>
        2.Tuck your elbows in at your sides and position your feet slightly apart.<br>
        3.Inhale. Push down until your elbows are fully extended but not yet in the straight, locked position. Keep your elbows close to your body and bend your knees slightly on the pushdown. Resist bending forward. Try to keep your back as straight as possible as you push down.<br>
        4.As you exhale, return to the starting point using a controlled movement. Try not to crash the weights.
      </p>
  <h3 class="prem">BENEFITS</h3>
<p>
  1.Increases Strength:
  Tricep pushdowns also benefit your overall strength and endurance by engaging your core, back, and shoulders.1 The move is also adaptable to your strength and level, as you can increase the weight as you go.<br>

  2.Prevents Injury:
  The muscles that make up the triceps are vulnerable to overuse injury from repetitive activities like throwing, swimming, and hammering motions. Repetitive stress injuries of the triceps can be prevented by training the triceps, including with tricep pushdowns.
