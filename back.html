              daily life. You can enhance the exercise with a lot of weight, and it targets lots of muscles at once,
              which helps challenge and activate your trunk. A barbell row also helps promote spine stability. <br>

              1.Stand in the starting position with your feet shoulder-width apart.<br>

              your hand wider than your shoulder and your elbows extended and pointing slightly outwards.<br>
              3.Brace your torso and keep your back flat. Don’t round it forward.<br>
              4.Lift the bar as you stand up. Use your hips and knees, not your back. Focus your eyes just ahead of your
              feet to keep your head and neck lined up with your torso.<br>
              5.Next, squeeze your abdominal muscles and bend forward at the waist so that your chest is at a 60-degree
              angle with the ground. Keep your chest up and out, your knees slightly bent, and let the weight hang.<br>

          <h3 class="prem">WHY PULLUPS ARE IMPORTANT ?</h3>
          <div class="exePara">
            <p>
              A pull-up is a compound, pull-type exercise which works a large number of muscles in your back, shoulders,
              and arms at the same time.<br>

              The following table lists information about pull-ups and the muscles that you use when performing
              pull-ups.<br>

              You can perform pull-ups by grasping a sturdy bar with a firm overhand grip and your hands separated by a
              distance roughly equal to your shoulder width. With your arms straightened, allow your body to hang from
              the bar. Next, pull yourself upward to the final position where your chest nearly touches the bar and your
              chin is over the bar.<br>

              While you're pulling, focus on keeping your body straight without arching or swinging. Once your chin is
              over the bar, you can lower yourself to the initial position. Note that while you perform pull-ups, you
              can either bend your knees and cross your feet or keep your legs straightened so long as your feet don't
              touch the floor.<br>

              It's also a good idea to avoid relaxing your muscles too much while in the initial position. Relaxing too
              much can place a great deal of stress on your shoulders joints.<br>

              As you may have imagined, there is a wide variety of different ways to perform pull-ups. Let's take a look
              at some of the more popular variations of pull-ups that you may encounter in your gym.

            <p>

              1.It's one of the few lifts that directly targets the hamstrings, a group of muscles often overlooked in
              the weight room.2 It also works your glutes, lats (upper back), and core.<br>
              2.Deadlifting reintroduces us to our body's backside—the hamstrings, glutes, and back. Posterior training
              balances the body, helping us stand taller and with greater strength.<br>
              3.In short, deadlifting will build muscle, improve your posture, give you balanced, full-body strength,
              and turn you into a total gym badass. After all, there's nothing quite like ripping heavy weight from the
              ground.<br>

            <h3 class="prem">HOW TO DO DEADLIFT?</h3>
            <p>
              Look on YouTube and you'll find a whole bunch of folks doing their best one-humped camel impersonations
              while dragging a barbell up their legs. Yeah, don't do that. Every time you deadlift, you should be
              totally focused on good form.

              Good form reduces injury risk. The risk is never zero, but good form distributes the lift's stress evenly
              across tissues rather than placing a destructive load on a specific area—the lower back, for example.

              Secondary to limiting injury risk, good form also boosts performance: The right muscles work at the right
              times to crane the bar from the floor to the lockout position. When you lift with good form, the bar
              follows a path that allows for efficient use of the legs, hips, and back.

        <div class="col-md-6 content">

          <h3 class="prem">BENIFITS OF THE LAT PULLDOWN</h3>
          <div class="exePara">

            <p>
              This exercise is an excellent substitute for pullups or chinups if you have difficulty performing these
              exercises or if you’re training to get there.<br>

              The lat pulldown activates some of the same muscles as doing a pullup, although to a lesser extent.<br>

              Also, because you’re seated during the lat pulldown, you can use your hip flexors and abdominals to
              stabilize your body as you perform it. In fact, one older study found that the pulldown recruited the
              abdominals more than the pullup did.<br>

              The lat pulldown also benefits athletes in many sports that require a similar pulling motion, such as
              swimming, gymnastics, wrestling, and cross-country skiing .

            </p>


            <h3 class="prem">How to Do the Lat Pulldown?</h3>
            <p>
              1.Start by sitting at a lat pull machine, facing the bar. Adjust the knee pad so your knees are bent at 90
              degrees and firmly under the pad and your feet are flat on the floor.<br>
              2.Reach up and grasp the bar a little wider than shoulder width. Extend your arms as much as you can
              without shrugging your shoulders or lifting off the seat.<br>
              3.Pull the bar down toward your upper chest, aiming for just below your collarbone. Think of pulling your
              elbows and shoulder blades down and back as you bring the bar down. Keep your body tall and in a slight
              backward lean, just past vertical at 70–80 degrees.<br>
              4.Hold the bar at your mid to upper chest for 1–2 seconds while squeezing your shoulder blades back and
              down.

              STARTING POSITION (SETUP):Sit facing the weight stack of the machine with your chest and abdomen against
              the chest pad. Place your feet flat on the floor or on the foot supports (if available).

              EXECUTION (ACTION): Pull the handles toward you until your hands are alongside your chest (or upper
              abdomen). As you bend your arms, your elbows should travel directly behind you, not out to the side.

            <h3 class="prem">Machine Row Variations</h3>

            <p>
              1.Although each manufacturer has its own version of the machine row, the same basic rules apply. Depending
              on the brand, the handles may be parallel, perpendicular, or diagonal; some machines have all three
              grips.<br>
              2.Pulling the handle through a high trajectory towards the chest targets the upper latissimus and
              trapezius (lower the seat), whereas a lower trajectory toward the abdomen targets the lower lats (raise
              the seat higher). <br>

          <h3 class="prem">WHAT IS THE STRAIGHT-ARM PULLDOWN</h3>
          <div class="exePara">
            <P>
              The straight-arm pulldown, also called the straight-arm lat pulldown, is an isolation exercise that
              targets the muscle groups in your upper back, shoulders, and arms. Although the straight-arm pulldown
              primarily activates the latissimus dorsi muscles on the sides of your back, it also works the posterior
              deltoids, triceps, rhomboids, and teres major muscles in your upper arms. Perform the straight-arm
              pulldown by standing in front of a cable pulley machine and lowering the cable attachment with a slight
              bend in your arms. Variations of the straight-arm pulldown use different equipment, like a pair of
              dumbbells or a resistance band.
            </p>
            <h3 class="prem">HOW TO DO STRAIGHT-ARM PULLDOWN ?</h3>
            <P>
              1. Attach a wide-grip bar or lat bar to one of the higher points on the cable machine.<br>
              2.Grab the handle with an overhand grip. Your grip should be slightly wider than your shoulders.<br>
              3.While maintaining long arms, initiate the downward movement by squeezing your lats and pulling the bar
              toward your hips. Allow your shoulder blades to move naturally.<br>
