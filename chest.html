            <p> The bench press is a compound exercise that involves the pectoralis major of the chest, the anterior
              deltoids of the shoulder, and the triceps brachii of the upper arm.1

              It builds strength as well as encouraging the growth (hypertrophy) of these muscles.</P>
            <h3 class="prem">HOW TO DO BENCH PRESS ?</h3>

            <p>
              1.Draw your shoulder blades back behind you to keep from pressing with rounded shoulders.<br>
              2.Grasp the barbell using an overhand grip, placing your thumbs on the outside of your closed fist. Your
              arms are slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and the angle of your upper arms is about 45 degrees to
              the body.<br>
              3.Remove the barbell from the rack, locking your elbows. Don't move the bar in an arc from the rack
              directly to the chest position.<br>
              4.Inhale while lowering the bar to your chest, at the nipple line.<br>
              5.Exhale as you press the bar above your chest, extending your arms. Don't watch the bar—focus on the
              ceiling.<br>
              6.Lower the bar so it is just above your chest. This is the starting position for the next bench press.

            <p>
              The classic dumbbell pullover is a widely used resistance exercise that primarily strengthens the muscles
              in the chest (pectoralis major). It also engages the large wing-shaped muscles in the back (latissimus
              dorsi), the core muscles, and the back of the upper arms (triceps).1

              The dumbbell pullover is considered a postural exercise2 as performing the full movement requires that you
              keep the spine in a lengthened, stable position. This move also helps open and increase the chest and
              upper body flexibility. These areas often become tight, especially in those with computer or desk jobs.3

              1. Extend your arms toward the ceiling, over your chest.<br>

              3. Inhale and extend the weights back and over your head, keeping a strong back and core. Take about 3 to
              4 seconds to reach a fully extended position where the weights are behind—but not below—your head.<br>
              4. Exhale slowly and return your arms to the starting position.<br>

              The dumbbell press allows you to specifically target chest muscles, giving you greater strength and
              definition. Because you have to balance the dumbbells individually, it also contributes to strong core
              development. You can do dumbbell presses on a standard flat weight bench or overhead while standing.
              Variations of the dumbbell press add depth to your workout routine.
