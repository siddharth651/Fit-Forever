              2.Set the Feet <br>

              3.Full Range of Motion Repetitions <br>

              4. Press Up and Repeat:
              Once you have reached full depth in the leg press, press your feet through the foot plate and lift the
              sled upwards. Be sure to not lose tension in the hips and core, keeping your hips and lower back on the
              seat. <br>

              1.Build Strength Post Injury:
              If you are experiencing any physical pain and discomfort during training and/or outside the gym, please
              seek out a sports medicine professional. <br>

              2.Increase Quadriceps Development:
              Increasing quadriceps hypertrophy and knee extension specific performance can be beneficial for a variety
              of athletes. Strength and power athletes rely on the quadriceps for heavy squats, making the leg press a
              good accessory exercise to add additional quadriceps mass while minimizing overall stress to the
              body/lower back/spine. <br>

              3.Minimize Direct Load in the Back:
              The leg press allows lifters and coaches to reduce loading on the spine yet still train the lower body.
              This can be beneficial for athletes recovering from injury and/or looking to limit additional stress while
              increasing lower body training volume. <br>

              1.The Set-Up:
              Stance will vary slightly from person to person, Tamir explains, but your feet should be between hip- and
              shoulder-width distance apart, with your toes slightly turned out (between 5 and 15 degrees). <br>

              2.The Squat:
              te the movement by sending the hips back as if you’re sitting back into an invisible chair. Bend knees to
              lower down as far as possible with chest lifted in a controlled movement. Keep lower back neutral. Press
              through heels to stand back up to the starting position. Repeat. <br>

              1.Raise your heels slowly, keeping your knees extended (but not locked). <br>
              2.Pause for one second when you're standing as much on the tips of your toes as you can. <br>
              3.Lower your heels back to the ground, returning to the starting position. <br>

              1.Standing calf raises activate the two muscles that run down the back of the lower leg: the gastrocnemius
              and soleus. These muscles are integral in ankle flexion and extension, propelling running and jumping.
              <br>
              2.The gastrocnemius also works in tandem with the hamstrings to control knee flexion, while the soleus
              maintains proper balance and pumps blood from your leg back up to your heart. When weak, the calf muscles
              strain and tear more easily. <br>

              1.Load the machine with your desired amount of weight. As a beginner, it’s recommended to get familiar
              with the movement of the machine before adding a bunch of plates. <br>
              2.Step into the machine, placing your feet shoulder-width apart and your shoulders and back against the
              pads. <br>
              3.Release the safety handles, inhale, and lower down, bending your knees until they reach a 90-degree
              angle. <br>
              4.Pause here, then push up through the back of your feet to extend your legs back to the starting
              position. <br>

              <b> 1.Quad Emphasis:</b> <br>
              As mentioned, the angle of the hack squat and the decrease in trunk activation mean your quads take on
              most of the load and volume. <br>

              <b> 2.Builds Your Hamstrings: </b> <br>
              The squat motion not only targets the quads and glutes, but also the hamstrings. Even though you are in an
              inclined position with a hack squat, there is still hamstring activation. <br>

              <b> 3.Hack Squats Build Core Strength: </b> <br>
              Full-body exercises such as deadlifts and squats require that big trunk activation. This requires strong
              abdominals. Hack squats also require core engagement, but it is much easier to focus on your core since
              you are locked into position. <br>

              1.Place your hands on the hand bars. <br>
              2.Lift the weight while exhaling until your legs are almost straight. Do not lock your knees. Keep your
              back against the backrest and do not arch your back. <br>
              3.Exhale and lower the weight back to starting position. <br>
              4.Do three sets of eight to 12 repetitions. <br>

              1.The leg extension targets the quadriceps, the large muscles of the front of the thigh. <br>
              2.The difference is that in the squat, the body part you're exercising is anchored (feet on the ground),
              while in the leg extension. <br>
              3.The quads are well-developed in cycling, but if your cardio is running or walking, which can be
              beneficial in sports such as soccer or martial arts. <br>
